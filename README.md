<p align=center> My name is Lawrence but most people online call me Carthy! 

 
I'm currently a high school student and it is my goal in life to become a great programmer and I strive to improve myself and learn more.

I'm a huge nerd when it comes to computers and tech stuff, I want to learn more about using Linux and ethical hacking, I listen to all kinds of music and I love to talk to new people and making new friends so feel free to contact me at my discord @Carthy#4084

Right now, I'm a complete newbie to programming and I've only recently started building my website and I hope to have it up sometime soon!

My goal is to learn and improve in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++ and C# by the end of my highschool career!
