<p align=center> My name is Lawrence but most people online call me Carthy! 

 
I'm currently a high school student and it is my goal in life to become a great programmer and I strive to improve myself and learn more.

I'm a huge nerd when it comes to computers and tech stuff, I want to learn more about using Linux and ethical hacking, I listen to all kinds of music and I love to talk to new people and making new friends so feel free to contact me at my discord @Carthypoo

Right now, I'm a FIRST Technical Advisor Assistant for the FIRST Robotics Competition which is an international youth organization that focuses on engaging young people in building science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation and foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.
