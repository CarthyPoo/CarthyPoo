<p align=center> My name is Lawrence but most people online call me Carthy! 

 
I'm currently a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and it is my goal in life to become a great programmer and I strive to improve myself and learn more.

I am currently in my first year of the [Information Technology Services Program]([url](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/information-technology-services))

I'm a huge nerd when it comes to computers and tech stuff, I want to learn more about using Linux and ethical hacking, I listen to all kinds of music and I love to talk to new people and making new friends so feel free to contact me at my discord @Carthypoo
